### P5

NO, the receiver can't be sure about no bit errors have occrurred. 

Cuzz the manner in which the checksum for the packet is calculated. If the corresponding bits of two 16-bit words in the packet were all 0 and all1(0multiply16 , 1multiply16) then if these get flipped to 1 and 0 respectively, the sum still remains the same. Hence, the 1s complement the receiver calculates will also be the same. This means the checksum will still verify even if there was transmission error.
