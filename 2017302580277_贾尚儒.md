1.task1 ：use python to calculate the 16 - bit checksum of UDP, and use the program to verify the calculation in 3.3.2

The program is linked [here](https://github.com/Drbuilders/hw5_udp.git). And the calculation in the book has been verified.




2.task2 :  I choose P2 P4

P2:

Suppose the IP addresses of the hosts A, B, and C are a, b, c. 

As for host A: source port =80, source IP address = b, dest port = 26145, dest IP address = a;

As for host C, left process: source port =80, source IP address = b, dest port = 7532, dest IP address = c; 

As for host C, right process: source port =80, source IP address = b, dest port = 26145, dest IP address = c.



P4:

a) Add the two bytes, and the result is 11000001. And the one’s complement is 00111110.  

b) Add the two bytes , the result is 01000000. And the complement is 10111111.  

c) The first byte is 01010100; and the second byte is 01101101.
