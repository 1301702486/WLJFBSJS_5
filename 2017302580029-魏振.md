### P4: Answer
a. The 1s complement of the sum of these 2 bytes is 0011 1110.  
b. The 1s complement of the sum of these 2 bytes is 1011 1111.  
c. If the last bit in each of the 2 bytes is flipped, that is the changed 2 bytes are separately 01011101 and 01100100, the 1s complement doesn't change.  
  
  
### P6: Answer  
Suppose the sender is in the state "Wait for call 0 from above" and the receiver is in the state "Wait for 0 from below". The sender sends a packet with sequence number 0, and transitions to "Wait for ACK or NAK 0", waiting for an ACK or NAK. Suppose now the receiver receives the packet with sequence 0 correctly, sends an ACK, and transitions to state "Wait for 1 from below", waiting for a data packet with sequence number 1. However, the ACK is corrupted. When the rdt2.1 sender gets the corrupted ACK, it resends the packet with sequence number 0. However, the receiver is waiting for a packet with sequence number 1 and always sends a NAK when it doesn't get a packet with sequence number 1. Hence the sender will always be sending a packet with sequence number 0, and the receiver will always be NAKing the packet. Neither will progress forward from that state.
