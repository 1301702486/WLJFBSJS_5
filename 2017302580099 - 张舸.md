## Problems

**R3**. Consider a TCP connection between Host A and Host B. Suppose that the TCP segments traveling from Host A to Host B have source port number x and destination port number y. What are the source and destination port numbers for the segments traveling from Host B to Host A?  

**Answer:**

The port should reverse when the receiver becomes the sender, so the source port is y and destination port is x



**R4.** Describe why an application developer might choose to run an application over UDP rather than TCP.  

**Answer**:

Although the UDP is unreliable which means it does not guarantee the delivery of the packet will be successful, but it's more fast and has lower cost. So in some condition where the reliability is not that important but the fast transmission with lower cost is wanted, we will use UDP rather than TCP.
